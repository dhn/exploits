# Exploits

Miscellaneous proof of concept exploit code for testing purposes.

## Current Exploits

* Fortinet FortiOS 6.0.0 <= 6.0.4, 5.6.0 <= 5.6.8, 5.4.1 <= 5.4.10: The magic backdoor (CVE-2018-13382)

## Licence

See individual exploits for their respective licences.

## Bug Reports

I'll take the quality of our exploit code very seriously. If you find a bug, or
an edge case where an exploit fails to succeed against a vulnerable target, do
let me know via issues or via email/twitter. 

## Changes

There is no changelogs here, as that would be too much effort, just git commits.
Exploits may be updated regularly for greater stability, reliability or
stealthiness.
