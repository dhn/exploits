# Exploits

Miscellaneous proof of concept exploit code for testing purposes.

## Current Exploits

* Strato HiDrive <= 5.0.1.0 LPE (CVE-2019-9486)
* Exim 4.87 < 4.91 LPE (CVE-2019-10149)

## Licence

See individual exploits for their respective licences.

## Bug Reports

I'll take the quality of our exploit code very seriously. If you find a bug, or
an edge case where an exploit fails to succeed against a vulnerable target, do
let me know via issues or via email/twitter. 

## Changes

There is no changelogs here, as that would be too much effort, just git commits.
Exploits may be updated regularly for greater stability, reliability or
stealthiness.
